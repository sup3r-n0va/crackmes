                         EASY LINUX CRACKME BY LORD
                         --------------------------

 Cracker   : kRio (krio@abv.bg)
 Tools     : strace v4.4 (you have it!)
 Protection: group id (hehe! :])
 Date      : 09/XX/2004

 Is this some kind of joke or what?  This is supposed  to  be  a crackme not a
kindergarden dummy program...  :(  Use STRACE  on  this crackme and you'll see
that it gets the group id  of  the current user  executing it and then it gets
compared to 0xDEAD.  If  it  matches you  get  the 'Okej!' message.  There are
thousand of ways to make  that check valid and the first that comes to my mind
is:

 step 1: login as root (I can't do this on my slackware remote shell...)
 step 2: "user@slackware.shell% groupadd -g 57005 -o linux_crackmes"
 step 3: add an user (example: cracker_31337) to that group
 step 4: "user@slackware.shell% strace -u cracker_31337 blah"

 You'll get the "Okej!" message....  :)  Only the priviliged super-duper users
of that 57007 group will have the rights to run this kick-ass crackme...

 PS: of course, you can always patch it... :)
